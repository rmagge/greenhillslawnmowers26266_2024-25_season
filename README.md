## Our Robot
### Chassis
###### Our robot drives with mecanum wheels. This allows our robot to strafe to the left and to the right as well as driving forward, backward, and turning.

### Arm
###### Our robot uses two HD Hex motors, which are both at 60:1 gear ratios, to lift our arm, which holds a linear slide to extend this arm and a claw to handle samples and specimen.

### Claw
###### Our claw has triangular pyramid-shaped grippers that move straight from side to side, which allows our claw to easily intake and hold a specimen or sample without it shifting in orientation.

### Code
#### Teleop
###### Our robot uses joysticks to drive, and we can adjust the speed by pressing the 'A' button. Our robot uses buttons and triggers to bring the arm and claw to coded positions so there is not a struggle to position these correctly.

#### Autonomous
###### During the autonomous portion of a match, our robot can park in the observation zone.

## Strategies
### Strategy I
###### Our main strategy is to score as many specimens as possible on the high chamber, scoring 10 points each during Teleop. During Endgame, we score a Level One Ascent.
### Strategy II
###### Our secondary strategy is to score as many samples as possible in the upper basket, scoring 8 points each during Teleop. During Endgame, we score a Level One Ascent.

## Green Alliance
###### The Green Alliance is a program started by our team, the Greenhills Lawnmowers III, in which we collect recyclables from recycling bins that we place at our school and at FIRST Competitions. Once we collect these recyclables, we recycle them. We do this to promote sustainability in our school, FIRST Robotics, and beyond.

## Strategic Partnerships - Autonomous Robotic Vehicles Club from the University of Michigan
###### We have partnered with the Autonomous Robotic Vehicles Club of the University of Michigan, which is made up of university students at the University of Michigan. These members help us with our Engineering Portfolio and judge presentation by allowing us to give them a mock judge presentation to them, and by giving us feedback on what we can improve.
